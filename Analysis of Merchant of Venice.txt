Analysis of A4 S1 - Merchant of Venice

The scene is set in Venice, where Antonio is on trial in the courtroom. The Duke of Venice expresses his sympathy towards Antonio and condemns Shylock as an inhumane monster who cannot feel pity or mercy. Antonio, however, maintains his composure and accepts his fate, saying that he will face Shylock's anger with a calm spirit.

The Duke questions Shylock's lack of mercy and asks how he expects to receive mercy when he offers none himself. Shylock replies that he has done nothing wrong and therefore does not need mercy. He compares his claim to Antonio's flesh to Christians who refuse to set their slaves free.

Portia's attempt to trick Bassanio into giving the ring she gave him to "Balthazar" appears designed to set him up for a later punishment for parting with his ring. It may be a punishment for Bassanio telling Antonio he would be willing to sacrifice his own wife to save Antonio's life. Portia is both clever and kind. Her ability to save Antonio when all the men around her have given up on doing so shows her wisdom is superior to that of all the other characters in The Merchant of Venice. Yet even Portia is not immune to the human desire for justice when she feels wronged by Bassanio.

As Shylock is about to cut into Antonio, Portia reminds him that he must not spill any blood. She urges him to continue collecting his pound of flesh, but warns him that if he spills any blood, he will be guilty of conspiring against the life of a Venetian citizen and forfeit all his wealth. The scene ends with Antonio bidding farewell to Bassanio, and both men expressing their willingness to sacrifice everything to prove their love for each other.
